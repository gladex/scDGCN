This README documents the necessary steps to set up the running environment for scDGCN.

### What is this repository for? ###

* scDGCN is a novel learning approach for deep structured clustering of single-cell sequencing data. It aims to provide researchers with a deep learning tool for single-cell clustering tasks.
* Current version: 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setting up scDGCN requires an environment with Python 3.8 or newer, along with PyTorch and other necessary machine learning libraries.
* Install all dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* scDGCN does not require database configuration.
* After setting up the dataset and pre-trained files, execute the code in the `scDGCN.ipynb` file in order.
* Since scDGCN is primarily used for research and development, it does not have a specific deployment guide. Please integrate it into your project or workflow as needed.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Please write appropriate tests for your contributions and ensure all tests pass.
* Submit pull requests for any changes. Project maintainers will review according to the project's coding standards.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Have any questions or issues related to the repository, please contact: Dr. Binhua Tang (bh.tang@outlook.com) or Guowei Cheng (221320010002@hhu.edu.cn).
